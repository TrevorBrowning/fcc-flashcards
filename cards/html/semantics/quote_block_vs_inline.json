    "back": "To represent an extended quotation from another source, usually displayed as an indented block."
  },
  {
    "front": "How do you attribute a source in a <blockquote> element?",
    "back": "Using the cite attribute (e.g., cite=\"https://example.com\") to specify the URL of the source."
  },
  {
    "front": "Does the cite attribute change how a <blockquote> looks in the browser?",
    "back": "No. It doesn't affect the visual presentation but provides metadata for screen readers and search engines."

    "front": "What is the purpose of the <q> element in HTML?",
    "back": "To mark a short, inline quotation within a paragraph. Browsers usually add quotation marks automatically."
  },
  {
    "front": "Can the <q> element use the cite attribute?",
    "back": "Yes. It works like in <blockquote>—providing source metadata without affecting appearance."
  },
  {
    "front": "What’s the main difference between <blockquote> and <q>?",
    "back": "<blockquote> is for long, standalone quotations. <q> is for short quotes within paragraphs."
  },

    "front": "When should you use a <blockquote> instead of a <q>?",
    "back": "Use <blockquote> for longer, multi-line or multi-paragraph quotes. Use <q> for brief, inline quotations."
