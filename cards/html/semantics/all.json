  {
    "front": "What does 'semantic' mean in the context of HTML?",
    "back": "In HTML, 'semantic' refers to the meaning that an element conveys. Semantic elements describe their purpose or content clearly (e.g., <p> for paragraphs)."
  },
  {
    "front": "How is writing an HTML document similar to writing a text document?",
    "back": "Both use structure and formatting like headings, paragraphs, images, and emphasis to organize and present content meaningfully."
  },
  {
    "front": "What is the semantic meaning of the <p> element?",
    "back": "It represents a paragraph of text."
  },
  {
    "front": "Which commonly used HTML element does NOT have semantic meaning?",
    "back": "The <div> element. It is a generic container without inherent meaning."
  },
  {
    "front": "Why is semantic HTML important for accessibility?",
    "back": "It helps assistive technologies like screen readers interpret the page structure and content more accurately, improving usability."
  },
  {
    "front": "How can semantic HTML improve SEO?",
    "back": "Search engines can better understand and index your content when semantic elements are used, potentially improving search rankings."
  },
  {
    "front": "How does semantic HTML help developers?",
    "back": "It makes code easier to read and maintain. For example, you can edit a <nav> element directly rather than searching through generic <div>s."
  },
  {
    "front": "What are three benefits of using semantic HTML?",
    "back": "Improved accessibility, better SEO, and clearer, more maintainable code for developers."
  },
  {
    "front": "What is the most important aspect of creating structural hierarchy in HTML?",
    "back": "The correct use of heading elements (h1–h6) in a meaningful order that reflects the structure of your content."
  },
  {
    "front": "What does the number in an <h1> to <h6> tag represent?",
    "back": "The heading level, with <h1> being the highest (top-level) and <h6> the lowest."
  },
  {
    "front": "How many <h1> elements should a page typically have?",

  {
    "front": "How does structural hierarchy affect SEO?",
    "back": "Search engines use heading structure to understand and rank content. Malformed structure can reduce visibility in results."
  },
  {
    "front": "What happens if HTML heading structure is incorrect?",
    "back": "Your HTML might be invalid. The browser will guess how to display it, which could produce unintended results."
  },
  {
    "front": "What’s the best way to style headings without affecting structural hierarchy?",
    "back": "Use appropriate heading tags for structure, and apply visual styles using CSS instead of choosing headings for their size."

  },
  {
    "front": "Can <b> and <strong> look the same visually?",
    "back": "Yes, both default to bold styling, but only <strong> communicates semantic importance to screen readers and search engines."
  },
  {
    "front": "How do you decide between using <b> or <strong>?",

  },
  {
    "front": "Is this structure valid?\n<dl><dt>Flour</dt><dd>2 cups</dd></dl>",
    "back": "Yes. 'Flour' is the term and '2 cups' is the related detail — this is a valid description list entry."
  },
  {
    "front": "Can description lists be used for things other than definitions?",
    "back": "Yes! They're useful for recipes, FAQs, product specs, contact info, and any key–value pair data."
  },
  {
    "front": "How are items typically styled in a description list by default?",

  {
    "front": "How do you attribute a source in a <blockquote> element?",
    "back": "Using the cite attribute (e.g., cite=\"https://example.com\") to specify the URL of the source."
  },
  {
    "front": "Does the cite attribute change how a <blockquote> looks in the browser?",
    "back": "No. It doesn't affect the visual presentation but provides metadata for screen readers and search engines."
  },
