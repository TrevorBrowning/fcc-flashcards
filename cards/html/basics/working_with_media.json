    "front": "How are PNG and JPG images classified?",
    "back": "As raster images, which are pixel-based."
  },
  {
    "front": "Why don’t raster images like PNG or JPG upscale well?",
    "back": "Because they are pixel-based, and enlarging them causes pixelation or blurring."
  },
  {
    "front": "How are SVGs different from raster images?",
